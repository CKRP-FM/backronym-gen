# Juno Project 4: Backronym Generator

## Overview

Backronym Generator is a web application that allows users to create a ‘backronym’ from an initial chosen word. A backronym is an acronym deliberately formed from a phrase whose initial letters spell out a particular word or words, either to create a memorable name or as a fanciful explanation of a word’s origin. ie “Biodiversity Serving Our Nation, or BISON”’.
